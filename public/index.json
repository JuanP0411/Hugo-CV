As well as allowing for a LLM (GPT 3.5) to interpret the diagnosis and signal possible causes for the diseas as well as recomendations to treat the plant.\nOverview #\rTechnologies Used: #\rTensorFlow: The machine learning framework that powers the image classification model. Python: The programming language used for developing the classifier and the FastAPI application. NumPy: A library for numerical operations, essential for data manipulation in the model. FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs. OpenAI: An API which allows for comunication with OpenAI LLMs like GPT 3.5. Streamlit: A Python library which allows for UI creation focusing on AI projects. Docker: Containerization technology for packaging the application and its dependencies. Project Components: #\rDataset:\nThe model is trained on a dataset containing images of mango leaves, both healthy and diseased. To manage all these images we used the numpy libraries functions to clean the dataset. In order to prepare it for the training we used the split functions from the scikit-learn library. TensorFlow Model:\nWe leverage the power of TensorFlow to create a deep learning model using the ResNet50V2 Base Model. Then we construct a custom model using a Sequential model from the keras module with the following layers:\nThe pre-trained ResNet50V2 model.\nBatchNormalization layer.\nDense layer with leaky ReLU activation, He normal initialization, and 512 units.\nAnother BatchNormalization layer.\nDropout layer with a dropout rate of 30%.\nDense layer with leaky ReLU activation, He normal initialization, and 128 units.\nAnother BatchNormalization layer.\nAnother Dropout layer.\nDense layer with softmax activation, Glorot uniform initialization, and 8 units (assuming it\u0026rsquo;s a classification task with 8 classes).\nBackEnd:\nWe use FastAPI to create a simple post endpoint to interact with the model. The request contains the image of a mango leaf, and the response returns the models prediction. This prediction is then passed to a prompt, which is then sent to GPT 3.5 with the help of the OpenAI python module. GPT 3.5 then returns possible causes for the disease as well as recomendations to treat it. FrontEnd:\nFinally we create a simple UI using streamlit. Streamlit allows us to easily implement image upload functinalities as well as a chat interface to interact with GPT 3.5.
